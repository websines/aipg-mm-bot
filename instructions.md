I have a simple next.js 15  app, and I want to make a grid trading bot, I have installed ccxt to connect to exchange.

I want to make a simple grid trading bot that uses ccxt to connect to exchange and then uses ccxt to place orders. The .env file has the access and secret key for "xt" exchange. 


Make a good ui for the user, no auth needed, just make sure it fetches all open orders, then current balance and all necessary details.
